### What this project is

A simple pocket calculator, built in React.

### TO DO
* Continue refactoring
* Add in floating point arithmetic
* Add in ability to operate in non-base 10 arithmetic
* Add in memory (M+, MR, MC keys)
* Add in clear button
* Add in 'repeat previous operation' ability by repeatedly pressing equal sign (so that `3 + 5 = =` will result in 13)
* Add in better parsing to avoid various errors if impossible key combos are pressed
* Add in button that reveals additional operators such as:
  - trig operations (sin, cos, tan, etc.)
  - scientific notation
  - log and ln
  - others?
* Add in button to copy result to clipboard
